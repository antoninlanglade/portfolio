			"description" : "Mirage is an interactive short film. This is my graduation project at Gobelins in the interaction design section. Edward loves his wife and his kid. He is afraid of anything that might happen to them. So he dreams of himself as being stronger, sharper and more aware of the world around him. To protect them. This is the story of a man who dreams of transhumanism. He dreams of IO, an artificial intelligence in his brain that can analyze a situation much faster than him and even suggest the best things he may chose.",
