	"long-description" : "I use to develop with JS (Frameworks with Backbone, Require.js, Grunt, Sass, etc) and Objective C (currently in Swift learning). First of all I am a designer before a developer. At Gobelins, we learn to build a project : starting with the idea and going until the end of the digital production. This is what we call the design process and that’s why I’m a designer.",
